            <h2>How long does fermentation take?</h2>
Fermentation usually takes 1-2 weeks but this can vary for different beer styles. Temperature plays a big role in fermentation as well and can also vary per style. The process can be challenging for some and may feel like a guessing game. Relax, stick to the plan. When it is getting close to the fermentation end time, take readings (using hydrometer) each day for around five days. When the readings come out the same three days in a row, I know it is ready.
<h2>How important is sanitizing?</h2>
Sanitizing is one of, if not the most important part in brewing. Any bacteria left or trapped inside will reproduce in your brew. The temperature you store your brew in is also a perfect temperature for bacteria. I like to remind everyone, sanitize everything, even the things you think you don’t need to, everything. I try to sanitize right before I use certain tools/products instead of doing it all at once then letting them sit until you need them.
<h2>How do I know what hops and grains to use?</h2>
This is all a part of the fun. Experimenting with various different ingredients is easy and can give your brew a variety of different flavors. It’s really up to you! Hops have different styles and aromas. You can choose how “hoppy” you would like your beer, for example, IPAs. Grains provide the sugars needed in fermentation but also flavor, mouthfeel, and color.
